        Many questions still surround this folk lore hero however one truth
        stands the test of time - John Henry fought the machines and John Henry
        won. It's said John Henry was born sometime during the 1840's however
        there is no firm confirmation on a date. What we do know is thanks to
        Guy B. Johnson, a Professor of Sociology at the University of North
        Carolina, who in the late 1920's investigated the this famous folk lore
        tale. From John Henry's

        "He concluded that John Henry was a real person who worked on and died
        at the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway's (C&O Railway) Big Bend Tunnel. The
        tunnel was built near Talcott, West Virginia, from 1870 to 1872
        (according to Johnson's dating)." Thanks to Mr. Johnson we've confirmed
        John Henry was a real person - woohoo! So why is John Henry famous?

        As the 1800's were coming to a close the industrial revolution was full
        steam ahead. John Henry was known as the hardest worker when it came to
        railroad labor but when machines started taking his co-workers jobs,
        John Henry had had enough. The story goes as follows "When the agent for
        the steam drill company brought the drill here," said Mr. Miller, "John
        Henry wanted to drive against it. He took a lot of pride in his work and
        he hated to see a machine take the work of men like him." So the stage
        was set and the battle begun - as the story goes "At the end of the
        day-long competition, John Henry had driven more steel with his 14-pound
        hammer than the mechanical contraption, but he died a martyr on the
        spot, exhausted by his Herculean efforts or perhaps from heartbreak on
        realizing what inevitably lay in store."
